         <p>There is a fun statue in Leeds that locals call '<objectName

            as <objectName ref="#object-Excalibur-shortIdentifier">Excalibur</objectName> or
            anything. Though the real <objectName ref="#object-Excalibur-longerIdentifier"

                     <p>The back and shoulders of the mask is inscribed with a protective spell in
                        Egyptian hieroglyphs formed of ten vertical and horizontal lines. This spell
                        first appeared on masks in the Middle Kingdom at least 500 years before
                        Tutankhamun, and comes from chapter 151 of the <title>Book of the
                           Dead</title>.</p>

                  <physDesc>
                     <p>The mask of Tutankhamun is 54cm x 39.3cm x 49cm. It is constructed from two
                        layers of high-karat gold that varies in thickness from 1.5-3mm. It weighs
                        approximately 10.23kg and x-ray crystallography shows that it is composed of
                        two alloys of gold with a lighter 18.4 karat shade being used for the face
                        and neck while a heavier 22.5 karat gold was used for the rest of the
                        mask.</p>
                     <p>In the mask Tutankhamun wears a nemes headcloth which has the royal insignia
                        of a cobra (Wadjet) and vulture (Nekhbet) on it. These are thought
                        respectively to symbolize Tutankhamun's rule of both Lower Egypt and Upper
                        Egypt. His ears are pierced for earrings. The mask has rich inlays of
                        coloured glass and gemstones, including lapis lazuli surrounding the eye and
                        eyebrows, quartz for the eyes, obsidian for the pupils. The broad collar is
                        made up of carnelian, feldspar, turquoise, amazonite, faience and other
                        stones.</p>

                           death mask of the 18th-dynasty ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun who
                           reigned 1332–1323 BC.</p>

                     <provenance>
                        <p>The mask of Tutankhamun was found in his burial chamber at Theban
                           Necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. On 28 October 1925 the
                           excavation team led by English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the
                           heavy sarcophagus and three coffins and were the first people in around
                           3,250 years to see the mask of Tutankhamun. Carter wrote in his diary:
                              <quote> The pins removed, the lid was raised. The penultimate scene
                              was disclosed – a very neatly wrapped mummy of the young king, with
                              golden mask of sad but tranquil expression, symbolizing Osiris … the
                              mask bears that god's attributes, but the likeness is that of
                              Tut.Ankh.Amen – placid and beautiful, with the same features as we
                              find upon his statues and coffins. The mask has fallen slightly back,
                              thus its gaze is straight up to the heavens. </quote>

                     <acquisition> In December 1925, the mask was removed from the tomb, placed in a
                        crate and transported 635 kilometres (395 mi) to the Egyptian Museum in
                        Cairo, where it remains on public display. </acquisition>

                              gold beard was no longer attached to the mask and was reattached to
                              the chin by use of a wooden dowel in 1944.</custEvent>
                           <custEvent when="2014-08"> In August 2014 when the mask was removed from
                              its display case for cleaning, the beard fell off again. Those working
                              in the museum unadvisedly used a quick-drying epoxy to attempt to fix
                              it, but left the beard off-centre. </custEvent>

                              2015 by a German-Egyptian team who used beeswax, a material known to
