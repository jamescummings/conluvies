               A Letter from a Gentleman in the City, to one in the
               Country. 
               
               Sir, 
               
               THE Nation being awakened out of that Lethar-gy,
               which for ſo many Years had bound up its Senſes, and deprived it
               of all feeling and Perception; begins at laſt to diſcern it's
               dan-ger and to provide againſt the ruine and miſchiefs which
               threaten it. Accordingly the Houſe of Commons have not only
               declared, nemine contradicente, That the Duke of York's being a
               PapiſtThis is a sample editorial note about the term papist.,
               hath given the greateſt countenance to the preſent Deſigns and
               Conſpiracies of the Papiſts, a-gainſt the King and Proteſtant
               Religion; but have brought in a Bill, Diſabling him to Inherit
               the Imperial Crown of this Realm. 
               
               Now, Sir, this being the Affair
               I deſign to Write freely to you about, I preſume in the very
               entrance to tell you, that they could do no leſs, without
               abandoning them-ſelves, and the whole Kingdom, to Bondage and
               Popery. And all true Engliſh Men as well as Proteſtants, are ſo
               ful-ly ſatisfied of the neceſſity and Juſtice of the courſe which
               they ſteer; that they not only applaud and commend them in what
               they have undertaken, but are ready to ſtake their Lives and
               Fortunes towards the ſeeing it effe-cted and accompliſhed. 
               
               
               [2]
               Sect. I. Nor, in the firſt place, can the Papiſts them-ſelves
               Condemn us for taking theſe due ways and Me-thods to ſecure our
               Religion, and preſerve our Lives and Properties; ſeeing they are
               not only agreeable to the Meaſures, (but much more modeſt) which
               they have ta-ken in Forreign Countries to preſerve their own.
               Shall it be lawful for the French, to endeavour to preclude Henry
               the 4th. from enjoying the Crown of France, be-cauſe he was a
               Proteſtant, and muſt it be unjuſt for the Engliſh to debar James
               Duke of York from attaining the Soveraignty over this Realm, that
               is a Papiſt? Shall the Pope and Church of Rome cheriſh and
               juſtify a Bloody War, upon the alone foot of his being of a
               different Re-ligion from what was received in that Nation? And
               ſhall not we be allowed to uſe ſuch legal means, as are
               conſiſtent with and warranted by our Conſtitution, to hinder a
               Papiſt from aſcending the Regal Throne of this Kingdom? Shall it
               be lawful for thoſe in the Communi-on of the Papal Church, to
               adviſe Phillip the 2d. of Spain to Murder his Son Charles, for
               ſpeaking only favourably of his Fathers Subjects in the
               Netherlands, who were called Lutherans? And ſhall not we have the
               liberty humbly to pray and deſire our King, to deſert a Brother
               who hath Plotted the Ruin of his Majeſties Subjects, and for no
               other reaſon but becauſe they are not Papiſts. And ſuppoſe it
               ſhould be ſaid; that theſe methods were not only unjuſt, but
               Condemned by ſome of the very Roman Communion; yet the deſparity
               is ſo great between a Pa-piſts arriving at the Government over a
               Proteſtant King-dom, and a Proteſtants being advanced to Reign
               over a Popiſh Countrey, that it will no ways follow from thence,
               that what the Parliament have undertaken, is in the leaſt
               
               [3]
               reprehenſible. For no Proteſtant Prince will either en-ſlave his
               Kingdom or Subjects to a Forreign Juriſdiction, nor call his
               People into queſtion for their Religion, pro-vided they be not
               influenced by the Principles of it, to diſturb the Government,
               and diſquiet the Civil Peace. So that Papiſts inſtead of
               receiving prejudice by having a Proteſtant Prince to rule over
               them, they become poſſeſt of many advantages as to ſafety, eaſe
               and immunities, which their being under a Popiſh King excludes
               them from. And therefore it is, that we find the Papiſts do no
               where ſo fully enjoy the Right and Liberties of mankind, as in
               ſome Proteſtant Nations, where they have had the Wit and
               Sobriety, not to moleſt their fellow Subjects, or Con-ſpire
               againſt the Government under which they live. So far as their
               Religion is found to have an Influence only up-a future Life, and
               meerly to endanger their own happi-neſs; they are pitied inſtead
               of being Capitally Proſecu-ted, and the worſt they are made to
               ſuffer, is now and then to be rationally accoſted by their
               Neighbours, and addreſſed unto by arguments, which may conduce to
               re-ctify and inſtruct their Judgments. Whereas through the having
               a Popiſh Prince Succeed over a Proteſtant Peo-ple, they become
               immediately ſubjected to the ſevereſt Puniſhments, and that upon
               the alone ſcore of their Chriſtian Profeſſion. It is not only
               lawful for ſuch a Prince to deſtroy thoſe of his Subjects, who
               diſagree from him in Faith and worſhip, but it is an
               indiſpenſable Duty upon him to do it. Nor is he only ſure of a
               Pardon up-on the accompliſhing ſo Bleſſed a work, but the merit
               of the Atchievement entitles him to unſpeakable Happineſs and a
               Glorious Crown.
